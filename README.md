## Quick overview
This theme extension for [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/)
is based on the
["Darcula Theme"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rokoroku.vscode-theme-darcula)
from [rokoroku](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/rokoroku)
and inspired by the original "Darcula" from [JetBrains](https://www.jetbrains.com/).

*At the moment, this theme has discrepancies with the Darcula theme for [Rider](https://www.jetbrains.com/rider/).
But I hope that sooner or later this theme will be equal to the original one.* ðŸ˜‰

## Installation

#### It's very simple

1. **Download** the extension (.vsix file).
2. **Install** the extension for your Visual Studio 2022.
3. Follow: **Tools > Theme > Darcula**.

That's it, the installation is complete!

## Font
You may have noticed that the font does not match the original one of JetBrains products.
To solve this issue, you need to [download](https://www.jetbrains.com/lp/mono/) 
and install fonts from the official JetBrains website.

Also, after choosing a theme, follow the path: 

**Tools > Options > Environment > Fonts and Colors**. 

In the Font field, select one of the JetBrains fonts (I highly recommend JetBrains Mono)

## Conclusion
Special thanks to [rokoroku](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/publishers/rokoroku),
without his work on the theme ["Darcula Theme"](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rokoroku.vscode-theme-darcula)
for [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
 this theme would not exist. VS Code theme has been [converted](https://github.com/microsoft/theme-converter-for-vs)
and slightly modified in the most poorly converted parts for Visual Studio.

Initially, I did this theme extension for myself and as an experiment and did not really count on any result, but now I hope that I have enough time and energy to finish it.

Thank you for installing and have a nice day!
